<h2><a name="I" id="I">I</a></h2>


<p>Leinster is the richest of Irish provinces, the heart
of Ireland, and for beauty it can challenge any of its
sisters, save in one respect only: it lacks the beauty
of wildness. What it has to show of most beautiful
lies within twenty miles of the capital. There is no
city north of the Alps which has so lovely surroundings
as Dublin&mdash;or so varied in their loveliness. Sea
and mountain, plain and river, all come into that range
of exquisite choice. But everywhere in it the beautiful
frame of nature has been modified and beautified
by man.</p>

<p>Since it is not possible, in the small space available,
to describe exhaustively the features of this great
province, which stretches from the sea to the Shannon
and from the Mourne Mountains to Waterford Haven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a selection must be made and indicated at once. First,
then, the county of Dublin itself, infringing a little on
Kildare. Secondly, the Wicklow Mountains and their
glens. Thirdly, that rich valley of the Boyne, which
was the heart of the ancient kingdom of Meath. But,
before details are dealt with, some general idea of the
topography must be given.</p>

<p>Suppose you are on deck when the mail boat from
Holyhead has been two hours out, or a little more (I
write here for strangers), you will see Dublin Bay open
before you. To your right, making the northernmost
horn of the curve, is the rocky, almost mountainous,
peninsula of Howth, and ten miles north of it you
see its shape repeated in the Island of Lambay.</p>

<p>Except for that, to the north and to the west,
coast and land are all one wide level, far as your
eye can reach&mdash;unless by some chance the air be so
rarefied that you discern, fifty miles northward, the
purple range of Carlingford Hills (still in Leinster),
and beyond them, delicate and aerial blue, the long
profile of the Mourne Mountains, where Ulster begins.</p>

<p>But to the south of the city (where it lies in the
bight of the bay, spilling itself northward along the
shore to Clontarf of famous memory, and southward
to Kingstown and beyond) mountains rise, a dense
huddle of rounded, shouldering heights, stretching away
far as you can see. Near Dublin they almost touch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
shore: one rocky spur comes down to Dalkey Island,
which was the deep-water landing place before Kingstown
harbour was built: it rises into the peaked fantastic
summit of Killiney Hill. Beyond it the coast
curves in a little, giving a bay and valley in which lies
Bray, our Irish equivalent for Brighton. The Bray
river marks the limits of County Dublin; and beyond
Bray again is the high, serrated ridge of Bray Head,
fronting the water in a cliff. Landward from it
rises, peak by peak, that exquisite chain of heights
which from Little Sugarloaf to Great Sugarloaf runs
back to connect here once more the main body of
mountains with the sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams in his picture has shown Bray Head
and the lesser Sugarloaf in a glow of light which
turns their heather covering to a golden pink; and
from his vantage on the slope of Killiney, he has
been able to catch the shape of Wicklow Head beyond
and between the nearest summits of this chain.</p>

<p>South of that, you, from your steamer, can distinguish
how the margin of land between mountain and
coast line widens progressively. Wicklow Head
shoots far out into the sea; and beyond it you can
trace the long, low coast of Wexford projecting
farther and farther from the hills. Wicklow, in truth,
is a ridge of mountains, with small apanages of lowland
on each side; Wexford, a level space east of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
mountains which separate it from the vast central
plain, nearly all of which is Leinster.</p>

<p>This mountain range, trending south and a little
west from Dublin, is the main feature of Leinster&mdash;well
marked in history. All the rest of the province
was the most fertile, the most accessible region in
Ireland, and therefore the first to be subdued. The
Normans made, indeed, their first landings in Wexford
and Waterford, but they quickly consolidated
their power in Dublin, which was itself a city of
foreign origin&mdash;which, even when they came in the
twelfth century, was Danish rather than Irish. Centuries
after that, when southern Ireland had slipped
completely from under foreign control, the &ldquo;pale&rdquo;&mdash;the
district centring round Dublin and varying from
reign to reign in its limits&mdash;always remained subject
to English law.</p>

<p>But the pale, however far it might stretch west
and northward, stopped at the base of the Dublin hills.
There the Irish clans of the O&rsquo;Tooles and O&rsquo;Byrnes
held sway in strong fastnesses; and even in the
nineteenth century, after the last great rising of 1798
had been put down in blood and fire, Michael Dwyer
could still hold out on these hills so securely that
Emmet, escaping from his ill-starred attempt in 1803,
found sanctuary within two hours&rsquo; march of those
castle gates which he had failed to storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>Climb those hills as Emmet climbed them. If you
care to follow the most tragic romance of Irish history,
get your car driver to bring you where Bride Street
joins Thomas Street, not far from the house where
Lord Edward Fitzgerald was taken (a tablet marks
it). There, in the wedge of mean yards enclosed by
Bride Street and Marshalsea Lane, was the site of
Emmet&rsquo;s armoury and arsenal, whence he issued out
that July night&mdash;to how ghastly a failure! Then you
can drive up Francis Street (the route he followed in
escaping) and so to the Green at Haroldscross where
he used to meet Miles Byrne, the Wexford rebel,
Emmet&rsquo;s right-hand man, but later a colonel of Napoleon&rsquo;s
army with the cross of honour upon his breast.
Beyond the Green is a little range of houses on the
right; somewhere there Emmet was taken by Sirr.
Farther still towards the hills is Rathfarnham, where
he lived during the long months of elaborate preparation;
and here it was that his faithful servant,
Anne Devlin, refused to betray his movements though
they half-hanged her between the shafts of a cart
Farther still, beyond Rathfarnham, a road takes you
past the Priory, the abode of John Philpot Curran,
that famous orator and patriot, whose daughter, Sarah,
was the heroine of Emmet&rsquo;s romance and of Moore&rsquo;s
lovely song, &ldquo;She is far from the land where her
young hero sleeps&rdquo;. In the grounds of the Priory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and of the neighbouring Hermitage, &ldquo;Emmet&rsquo;s
Walk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Emmet&rsquo;s Seat&rdquo;, are shown: that old story
has left many marks. Curran&rsquo;s name has not been
so cherished: instincts are quick in Ireland, though
it is only within the last few years that we have
learnt how mean a part the great orator played in
that tragic history. Yet it is worth glancing at the
Priory, for here came all that was famous in Ireland&rsquo;s
most famous day: famous orators, famous
duellists, patriots, and placemen&mdash;worse even than
placemen, for Curran&rsquo;s closest friend was Leonard
MacNally, who for a lifetime posed as the champion
of men like Emmet, and for a lifetime sold their secrets
to Government, while acting as their advocate in the
courts where they were tried for dear life.</p>

<p>All the great houses that stud the lower slope of
these hills, with parks about them, and with much
beautiful decoration inside, are work of that period
in the eighteenth century when Ireland had her brief
prosperous hour, when her capital was in truth a
metropolis. To-day, as you rise above this belt of
wooded land and make your way out on to the slopes
of Three Rock or Kilmashogue or Tibradden&mdash;the
nearest heights&mdash;you will look over a country not much
changed in aspect probably, save that land which
was then cornbearing is now nearly all in grass.
The city itself spreads wider than it did in Grattan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>&rsquo;s
day&mdash;there has been a great movement out along
the shore of the bay. But the building has been
mostly of houses for people with small means and
narrow ambitions. The great houses of great men
that clustered within a short radius of College Green
are great houses no more. South of the river they
have become public buildings: Lord Castlereagh&rsquo;s a
Government office in Merrion Street, &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; Whalley&rsquo;s
the old University College, and so on. But on the
north side, Lord Moira&rsquo;s mansion, once a marvel of
splendour, is to-day a mendicity institution; and few
of the fine houses of that period have had even so
lucky a fate. With their elaborate, plaster-moulded
ceilings, their beautiful entrance fanlights, and all the
other marks of that admirable period in domestic
architecture, they house squalid poverty to-day, each
room a tenement. The growth of Dublin is illusory.
In Grattan&rsquo;s time it was one of the great capitals of
Europe. To-day it is something between a hope and
a despair.</p>

<p>But this is history. I return to topography.</p>

<p>From your height on the Dublin hills you can look
over two-thirds of Leinster. Southward, the mountains
hide Wicklow and Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny.
But over all that vast plain, stretching in champaign
north and west, your eye can travel till it reaches far
into Ulster on the north, and westward there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to stop it between you and the Shannon. This is a
country of many rivers. The Liffey flows out below
your feet. Five-and-twenty miles northward the
Boyne has its estuary. All the rest of the plain
is drained southward&mdash;part into the Shannon, and so
ultimately westward, but most into the great systems
of the Nore and Barrow; and ill they drain it. For
twenty miles inland is choice soil, but beyond that
you reach the central bog of Allen, where long expanses
of brown heather or of land only half-reclaimed
make up a landscape of melancholy charm. Such a
scene as Mr. Williams has drawn somewhere in the
Queen&rsquo;s County is intensely typical of this midland
country. Even where the furze blossom makes a
flicker of gay colour, the whole effect is dismal, and
its loneliness is constantly accentuated by what he
has suggested, the flight of wild marsh-haunting birds:
the trees are apt to be stunted and weather-twisted
by winds off the &ldquo;stormy Slieve Bloom&rdquo;, whose veiled
purple shapes are shown against the western sky in
his picture.</p>

<p>Yet the folk of this outer pale are &ldquo;kindly Irish of
the Irish&rdquo;&mdash;none kindlier; and I have often thought
the character of Ireland could not be better expressed
than in a chance phrase I heard in the talk of a girl
from that low-lying region. &ldquo;My father used always
to tell me: &lsquo;Put plenty of potatoes in the pot, Maria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
You couldn&rsquo;t tell who would be stepping in to us
across the bog&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving out of sight, because I must, the famous
city of Kildare with its Cathedral (half-church, half-fortress);
the broad lakes of West Meath, endeared
by hope to patient anglers; the city of Kilkenny,
where something of Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity remains unbroken,
where the Butlers&rsquo; Castle stands undestroyed,
where are churches that were never ruined (almost
a prodigy in Ireland); saying nothing of Lissoy, where
Goldsmith lived in the village that his pen immortalized;
briefly, dismissing about two-thirds of Leinster
with a wave of the hand, let me come back to Dublin
and its environment.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>II</h2>

<p>Of Dublin itself, what shall be said? A much-travelled
Belgian priest told me recently that only
in Naples had he seen such widespread marks of
destitution, and in Naples they have little to suffer
from cold. A young Irish nationalist, London-bred,
describing the emotion with which he made his first
visit to the country he had worked so hard for, said
that his week in Dublin left one leading impression
on his mind&mdash;the saddest people he had ever seen;
nowhere had he heard so little laughter. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
lived near poverty all his life in London and yet had
not seen so many pinched and drawn faces. All this
is true, especially on the north bank of the Liffey.
And yet an artist who came with me once to the
city spent his days in rapture over the beauty of the
public buildings. That also is true. The King&rsquo;s
Inns, the Four Courts, and the Custom House on the
north side of the river; in College Green, the front
of Trinity College and the old Parliament House,
(still&mdash;in 1911&mdash;the Bank of Ireland), are all splendid
examples of the severe Georgian style of architecture,
which found even happier expression in many noble
and nobly ornamented dwelling houses. All this
building was done in the latter part of the eighteenth
century, when Dublin had its day, when it was in
reality the capital of Ireland.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">NEAR ABBEYLEIX, QUEEN&rsquo;S CO</p></div>
</div>

<p>Traces of its earlier history are found in the Castle,
Norman built, but standing where the Danish founders
of the city set their stronghold by the ford above the
tideway; and in Christ Church, first founded by the
Danes when in the eleventh century they came over
to Christianity. Skilful restoration of the cathedral
has disclosed much of the early fabric&mdash;Norman work
on Danish foundations. And yet that ancient Danish
stronghold interests me no more than Cæsar&rsquo;s Londinium;
nor does the medieval city hold any charm for
my mind&mdash;lying as it did outside the real life of Ireland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>merely a fortress of a foreign power. Strongbow&rsquo;s tomb
is there to see in Christ Church, but to my thinking
a far more significant monument is to be found in the
other cathedral, St. Patrick&rsquo;s. Dublin as we know
it, the capital and centre of an English-speaking
Ireland, really dates from the eighteenth century;
and its first outstanding and notable figure was
Jonathan Swift, the immortal Dean. The Deanery,
in which were spent the most remarkable years of
his splendid and sinister existence, stands outside
the main entrance; near that entrance, in the south
aisle, surmounted by a small bust, is the marble slab
which enshrines his famous epitaph. I translate it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Jonathan Swift, for thirty years Dean of this Cathedral, lies
here, where fierce indignation can no longer prey upon his heart.
Go, traveller, and imitate, if you can, him who did a man&rsquo;s part
as the strenuous upholder of liberty.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The liberty which Swift upheld was the liberty of
Ireland. He sought to free Ireland from that system
of laws restricting all industrial development, whose
consequences are with us to-day. He came to Dublin
in 1715, a politician in disgrace, and was hooted in
the streets. Seven years later he was king of the
mobs, and no jury could be bullied to convict, no
informer could be bought to denounce, when Government
sought the author of those pamphlets which
every living soul knew to be his. He began the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
which Grattan and the volunteers completed&mdash;yet he
was an Englishman and no lover of Ireland. Born
in Ireland by chance, bred there of necessity, consigned
to a preferment there against his hope and
will, he was spurred on to work for Ireland by that
<i>saeva indignatio</i> which his epitaph speaks of, which
he himself renders in this sentence of a letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Does not the corruption and folly of men in high places eat
into your heart like a canker!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">The greatest perhaps of British humorists, he died
mad and miserable; and died as he expected to die.
His other monument is Swift&rsquo;s Hospital, built for a
madhouse out of the money willed by him in a bequest,
which his savage pen thus characterized:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;He left the little wealth he had<br />
To build a house for fools and mad,<br />
And showed by one satiric touch<br />
No nation wanted it so much&rdquo;.<br />
</p>

<p>In the north transept an epitaph written by Swift
marks the tomb of &ldquo;Mrs. Hester Johnson, better
known to the world by the name of &lsquo;Stella&rsquo;, under
which she is celebrated in the writings of Dr. Jonathan
Swift, Dean of this Cathedral&rdquo;. The world has always
wanted to know, and never will know for certain,
whether she ought to have borne the name of him
who celebrated her. But his bones were laid by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
hers, and still lie there, under a column in the nave;
though the indecency of antiquarians dragged out
their skulls when the cathedral was under restoration,
made a show of them at parties, and preserved
a memorial of this outrage in plaster casts, now deposited
in the robing-room.</p>

<p>You can see also, in the vestry, not a cast, but
the authentic skull of William&rsquo;s General Schomberg,
who fell in glory at the head of victorious troops
crossing the Boyne. You can read also Swift&rsquo;s epitaph
on the tomb which Schomberg&rsquo;s relatives and heirs
declined to pay for, leaving the pious task to Swift
and his chapter. The Latin sentence keeps the vibrant
ring of Swift&rsquo;s indignation. If only his ghost could
write the epitaph of those who ransacked tombs and
groped among mouldering relics of the immortal and
unforgotten dead, to find objects for a peepshow!
Yet after all it is in keeping with the story. In the
dark end of Swift&rsquo;s life, while he paced his guarded
room between keepers, servants used to admit
strangers for a fee, to see that white-haired body
which had once housed so great and terrible a mind.</p>

<p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, which Swift made famous,
dates, like Christ Church, from Norman builders; but
it was renovated fifty years ago at the cost of Sir
Benjamin Guinness, head of the famous brewery.
Christ Church, on the other hand, was rebuilt out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
whisky&mdash;the restorer was Mr. Henry Roe. Broadly
speaking, the century which began with the legislative
Union was marked in Dublin by the growth of distilling
and brewing and the decay of all other industries.
Guinness&rsquo;s is to-day one of the sights of the city, and
admission by order, easily procurable, will take the
visitor over the biggest thing of its kind anywhere to
be seen&mdash;and, let it be said, one of the best managed.
Nowhere are workmen better treated, and no rich
manufacturers have made more public-spirited use of
their wealth. Dublin owes to Lord Ardilaun not only
the opening but the beautification of St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Green, once an enclosure but now a very attractive
public park in the middle of the city&rsquo;s finest square.
We may well thank Providence for this one great
industry&mdash;but of how many it has had to take the
place!</p>

<p>Dublin in its metropolitan days was a true centre
of craftsmanship and art. I have spoken of the architecture,
which used so finely the dove-coloured limestone
of Wicklow. Gandon, who designed both the
Four Courts and the Custom House, was not Irish,
but Ireland gave him his opportunity and in Dublin
only can he be judged. No great painter adorned
that period among us; but all the subsidiary arts
flourished exceedingly. Horace Walpole used to send
across his books to be bound; Sheraton, Chippendale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>&rsquo;s
rival, was a Dublin artist-craftsman; glass-cutting,
silversmiths&rsquo; work, all these things furnished men
with infinite skill of hand and grace of design.
Within twenty years after the Union all these things
had vanished like a dream.</p>

<p>Except Guinness&rsquo;s stout, the nineteenth century
has little to show that is local and characteristic and
excellent. It can best afford to be judged by Foley&rsquo;s
admirable statues of our Irish worthies. Burke and
Goldsmith stand outside Trinity College, to which they
belonged&mdash;though poor Goldsmith had even less cause
than Swift to love the stepmother of his studies.
Doubtless Goldsmith was not easily distinguished from
the ruck of troublesome undergraduates, and that dignity
with which the sculptor has invested his odd and
appealing ugliness was not evident except to the eye
of genius. Grattan holds the centre of College Green,
a dominating figure near those walls which he filled
with stately eloquence. O&rsquo;Connell, the great tribune
of a later day, stands lifted on an elaborate monument
in the street, and facing the bridge, which now bear
his name&mdash;at the other end of that broad promenade
and thoroughfare (which part of Ireland still calls
Sackville Street, not so much out of love for a forgotten
Viceroy as out of dislike to the change) there
will stand from 1911 onwards a newer memorial to
a later leader&mdash;the monument which Augustus Saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Gaudens designed to commemorate Parnell. The
famous American sculptor has set his bronze figure,
of heroic size, on a low pedestal; but behind it rises
an obelisk of brown Galway granite, inlaid with
bronze and crowned with tripod and leaping flame.
Thus Dublin possesses the only work by this artist
(Dublin born, of a French father and an Irish mother)
which the United Kingdom can show, save for the
small medallion of Stevenson in Edinburgh. In
America, where he lived and worked, his fame is
established by many examples.</p>

<p>Moore, a national hero hardly less popular in his
day than even O&rsquo;Connell or Parnell, has been much
less happy in his statue. It faces the Bank of Ireland
in Westmorland Street, and is, in truth, very absurd
and ugly. But Moore&rsquo;s volatile charm of countenance,
which a hundred contemporaries describe, did not lend
itself to reproduction in bronze. More interesting by
far is the tablet in Aungier Street, which marks the
little shop where he was born and bred, and from
which he issued forth on the most amazing career
of social conquest recorded in the annals of society.
The earliest and best of the <i>Irish Melodies</i> were
written in Dublin about 1810; but Moore&rsquo;s parents
had before then moved to a little house near the
Ph&#339;nix Park, where the son&rsquo;s influence procured his
father a sinecure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>The group of poets who succeeded Moore&mdash;writers
of the Young Ireland Movement in 1848&mdash;find their
commemoration in the bust of James Clarence Mangan,
recently erected in Stephen&rsquo;s Green&mdash;almost as unobtrusive
as was in life that strange and unhappy genius.</p>

<p>To-day, as the world knows, we have poets neither
few nor unremarkable&mdash;Mr. Yeats chief among them;
and one of the intellectual landmarks of Dublin is the
Abbey Theatre, standing obscurely enough, but not
obscure in the world. Here have been produced the
poetical dramas of Mr. Yeats himself, the still more
notable prose dramas of Mr. Synge, together with much
work of Lady Gregory, William Boyle, Padraic Colum,
and many lesser names; and they have been produced
by a company of Irish actors&mdash;first formed by Mr. W.
G. Fay&mdash;who have displayed an amazing range of
talent. Any visitor to Dublin who cares for a beauty
and an interest wholly unlike that of the usual machine-made
play ought to try and see a performance at the
Abbey.</p>

<p>For the artistic life of Ireland&mdash;past, present, and
to come&mdash;Dublin is your only ground of study. Among
the things which every lover of Ireland should have
seen are two&mdash;the Book of Kells in the Trinity
College Library, the Cross of Cong in the Kildare
Street National Museum. The craftsmanship of art
was never carried to a higher point than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
marvellous illumination of that manuscript, the equally
marvellous inlaying of the famous reliquary. These
are only the masterpieces, each in its own kind; they
are the index of a civilization which existed before the
Norman crossed to Wexford. How far back native
Irish civilization stretches is matter for the archæologists;
but in Kildare Street is a wonderful collection
of the ornaments, weapons, and utensils, from gold
fibulæ to flint arrowheads, which are the documents
of that research.</p>

<p>And at the other end of the history, belonging rather
to the twentieth century than the nineteenth, is the
choicest collection of modern painting which these
islands can show&mdash;the Municipal Gallery in Harcourt
Street, gathered together by the enterprising genius
of Sir Hugh Lane. The house itself is a monument of
the eighteenth century: it belonged to Lord Clonmell,
judge, placeman, and duellist; and it is a fine example
of the Georgian domestic architecture. The gallery
is rich in pictures of the Barbizon school, and with
them can be seen the work of a living Irish landscape
painter who worked in his youth along with that
group. If Mr. Nathaniel Hone had chosen to exhibit
outside of Dublin, his name would to-day be widely
known, and there are pictures of his there&mdash;pictures
of the low-lying Leinster coast by Malahide and Rush&mdash;well
able to hold their own beside the famous French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>men&rsquo;s
masterpieces. There also can be seen an
interesting gallery of portraits by a painter, bred and
trained in Dublin, who, although still young, is reckoned
among the greater names of British art&mdash;Mr. William
Orpen. The portraits are not all examples of his
best work, but they are strongly characterized studies
of contemporary men and women widely known in
Ireland and outside Ireland. Another artist is represented
there too, but not at his best: for an adequate
example of the work of Walter Osborne, whose untimely
death robbed Ireland of more than she could
afford to lose, it is necessary to visit the National
Gallery of Ireland&mdash;on all accounts, indeed, well worth
visiting. But this one picture of a tree-bordered
meadow, with cattle grazing quietly in the sun-dappled
shade, and beyond it the whitewashed front and blue
slate roof of a long shed, renders a subject so characteristic
of Ireland, so characteristic above all of
Leinster, in its exquisite colour, its sense of large
air, its leisurely charm, that no one can look at it
without there stealing into his heart that beauty of
Ireland, which is not scenic, which has no striking
features, and yet which is the most intimate, the
homeliest, and perhaps the loveliest of all.</p>

<p>Beauty of this kind stretches away from Dublin
north and west over the broad fertile plain of Fingal,
the territory of the &ldquo;White Strangers&rdquo;, the fair-haired
Norsemen. You can find such beauty, with scenic
accessories, in the famous Ph&#339;nix Park&mdash;so called
by corruption of the Gaelic name given to a well
there, <i>Fionn Uisge</i>, the Bright Water. The wide
expanse of the park has lovely glades, deer-haunted
like the one which Mr. Williams has pictured; it
has backgrounds of mountain, the Dublin hills looming
up to the south; it has foregrounds of cricket
matches, or, better still, of hurling. Hurley is the
most picturesque game I have ever seen played, except
polo; and polo, too, in the summer, you can
watch in the Ph&#339;nix at its very best, though the
splendid ground is less beautiful than it was before the
great &ldquo;February storm&rdquo; of 1903 swept down the long
line of elms which bordered it. Still, in &ldquo;horseshow
week&rdquo;, when the cup matches are on, all the world can
go and see, &ldquo;free, gracious, and for nothing&rdquo;, one of
the finest spectacles that modern civilization can afford.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A HAWTHORN GLADE, PHOENIX PARK</p></div>
</div>

<p>Skirting the park to the south, and trending westward,
is the valley of the Liffey, and no one looking
at the unsightly, sometimes unsavoury, stream which
divides Dublin would guess at the beautiful water which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>the Liffey-bred salmon reaches in a couple of miles
after he has left the sea. Mr. Williams has drawn a
reach of it, still in the tidal limit, at Palmerston, halfway
to Leixlip&mdash;that is Salmon Leap: the Norse
name tells its story of the city&rsquo;s founding. The picture
shows the steep wood leading up to green expanses of
the park on the south side; and in the gap seaward,
all the vague expanse of brick and stone. Within
an easy ride from the park&mdash;how often Swift rode it!&mdash;is
the village of Celbridge, where his &ldquo;Vanessa&rdquo;,
Esther Vanhomrigh, settled herself to be near the
man she loved so fatally. The Liffey where it borders
Vanessa&rsquo;s Marley Abbey, and lower down, where it
skirts Castletown demesne, may challenge comparison
for beauty with any of Ireland&rsquo;s rivers. By its bank
famous men grew up&mdash;Charles, George, and William
Napier, sons of the beautiful Lady Sarah Lennox;
nephews, therefore, of Lady Louisa Connolly, whose
husband then owned Castletown, and first cousins of
Lord Edward Fitzgerald, whose home was near by,
at Carton, the seat of his father the Duke of Leinster.
The conqueror of Sind and the historian of the Peninsular
War got their schooling in Celbridge. They
formed in their school a class of boy scouts against
the troublous days of the &ldquo;Ninety-Eight&rdquo; rising; and
yet their sympathies were largely with their cousin,
Lord Edward, most picturesque among its leaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>He was not the first rebel in the famous Geraldine
family. Carton gates open from the little town of
Maynooth, where, outside the famous ecclesiastical
college, stands the ruin of that strong castle which
was the seat of the Geraldine power when all Ireland
could not rule the Earl of Kildare and therefore it was
settled that the Earl of Kildare should rule all Ireland.</p>

<p>And over against the castle is a yew of portentous
size and age, which bears the name of Silken Thomas&rsquo;s
tree. In 1534 the Earl of Kildare, Lord Deputy of
Ireland, had been summoned to Henry VIII and
detained in the Tower; his son Thomas remained in
Ireland with power as Vice-Deputy. After a few
months the rumour came that Kildare had been put
to death&mdash;a rumour no way incredible. His son, in
natural indignation, determined to owe Henry no
more allegiance, and on St. Barnabas&rsquo; Day rode into
Dublin with one hundred and forty followers wearing
silken fringes to their helmets. The council was fixed
to be held in St. Mary&rsquo;s Abbey, and the Geraldine troop
rode splashing through the ford of the Liffey to the
north bank. In the council chamber sat the Chancellor,
Archbishop Cromer, and Silken Thomas, with
his armed followers tramping in at his heels, renounced
his allegiance, and called on all who hated
cruelty and tyranny to join him in war upon the
English. His speech ending, he proffered his sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of state to the Archbishop, who refused to take it
and reasoned pathetically with the young noble. But
a hereditary bard of the Geraldines, O&rsquo;Neylan, burst
in with an Irish poem which recalled the glories of
the Geraldines, and upbraided Silken Thomas with
too long delay. The chant ended in a clamour of
applause from the armed men, and Thomas Fitzgerald,
flinging down the sword, marched at their head out
of the presence, none daring to check him.</p>

<p>Yet his attempt came to nothing. As always, the
other great Anglo-Norman family, the Butlers, sided
against the Geraldine, and from their stronghold in
Kilkenny harassed him while he endeavoured fruitlessly
to reduce Dublin Castle. Months went by,
and Silken Thomas was little more than the head
of a roving guerrilla force; but he roved at large.
At last, in March, 1535, Skeffington, the Lord Deputy,
moved out to the capture of Maynooth. His batteries
made a practicable breach within five days, and then
the commander, Christopher Paris, foster-brother to
Silken Thomas, thought it was time to make terms
for himself. The plan was ingenious. By concert
with Skeffington the garrison of a hundred men were
allowed to make a successful sortie and capture a
small cannon. Paris filled them with praise, and
with drink. At dawn of the next morning the walls
were stormed by a surprise, and so the castle fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of forty prisoners taken, twenty-four were
hanged. Paris received his stated price from Skeffington,
but with the money in his hand was marched
straight to the gallows, and from that day the &ldquo;pardon
of Maynooth&rdquo; became a byword.</p>

<p>Silken Thomas surrendered in July, lay destitute
in the Tower for sixteen months, and was then hanged,
drawn, and quartered at Tyburn with his five uncles,
of whom two had always been strong supporters of
the English power. One male scion of the Geraldines
was left, Silken Thomas&rsquo;s half-brother Gerald, and the
hunt was hot after him. His southern kinsmen, the
Geraldines of Desmond, refused him shelter, but he
got it from the O&rsquo;Briens of Thomond, still independent
rulers, and after long months escaped to Italy, where
he lived till Edward VI restored him. And from that
day to this, the line has lasted in Kildare, and the
Duke of Leinster holds foremost place among Irish
nobles. Yet Leinster House, the great building which
the National Gallery adjoins, is now only the home
of the Royal Dublin Society; and though the Geraldines
still own Carton, they are landlords no longer,
having sold all they owned, under the Act of 1903,
passed by one himself in part a Geraldine&mdash;Mr. George
Wyndham, son of Lord Edward&rsquo;s granddaughter.</p>

<p>Not far from Maynooth, in the wide grounds of
Clongowes Wood College, you can see a section of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the actual &ldquo;pale&rdquo;&mdash;a broad ditch and dyke which
fenced in the region under English shire law. A few
miles more would bring you to the famous Curragh
of Kildare. But to visit these things one must lose
sight of the sea, and that is a pity, for nowhere in
Ireland does the sea come more beautifully into landscape
than in Leinster, and especially about Dublin
itself. North of the city are broad stretches of green
fields, which lead the eye out to that still wider level
of blue&mdash;colour laid cleanly in mass against colour.
Sometimes between the pasture land and the ocean
lies a stretch of sand links, beloved of golfers, who
have classic ground at Dollymount on the North
Bull; at Portmarnock, with the exquisite view of
Howth and Ireland&rsquo;s Eye drawn by Mr. Williams;
and, most interesting of all, in the island links at
Malahide. This strange jumble of sandhills by the
mouth of the pleasant little estuary has a special
interest as a bird sanctuary; the terns breed there
in hundreds during June and July.</p>

<p>But for the beauty of all beauties neighbouring
Dublin, give me Howth, the mountainous peninsula,
almost an island, all but a mountain, which makes
the northern limit of Dublin Bay. In all that long
low eastern shore it is the only piece of cliff scenery
(for Bray Head can scarcely deserve the title) and
it commands an amazing prospect. On the north of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
it lies the little old town, the quaint and beautiful
harbour with its seawalls, and across a narrow sound
off the harbour is the little, uninhabited, cliffy, fern-covered
island of Ireland&rsquo;s Eye. &ldquo;Eye&rdquo; is Danish
for island; Howth is &ldquo;hoved&rdquo; (head), and the people
of Fingal keep near the Danish word, pronouncing
almost Ho-at. The Irish name was Benn Edair,
(Edair&rsquo;s Cliff), and many a time it comes into Irish
story, mostly as the point from which heroes sailed
or at which they landed. Howth was the general
landing place for Dublin until Kingstown Harbour
was constructed about a century ago and called
after George IV. But of all the heroes and kings
and commonalty who crossed the Channel, none
deserves mention more than Mr. Robert Loraine, the
actor. He flew from Anglesey, and had all but
accomplished his exploit when something broke,
and he directed his aeroplane to Howth, which
was the point nearest. A level shore he might have
reached, but the cliff rose too high for his sinking
wings to surmount, so he plunged into the water a
stone&rsquo;s throw from land, and swam ashore somewhere
near the Old Bailey Lighthouse, which stands on a
historic site, Dungriffen, that is the Fortress of Criffan.
Now Criffan (or Crimhthann) was King of Ireland in
the fourth century, at the beginning of the period
when Irishmen made many forays on the seas&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>in
one of which Saint Patrick was captured and
brought a slave to Ireland. A good many people
think all this history legendary, a pack of fables.
And very probably, if you had told Crimhthann,
when he ruled in his dun (or even the builders of
the Bailey Lighthouse when they were at work on
his old rampart), that a gentleman would come flying
across from England and drop like a winged bird off
this promontory, they also would have been a trifle slow
of belief. Anyhow, Howth Head, with its memories
of ancient robber kings, Irish and Danish, and of all
the folk who landed there from Chester, or from
Anglesey, down to this last and most surprising
debarkation of all, is surely a place of associated
landmarks in history, as well as probably the most
beautiful spot in Ireland.</p>

<p>Often on a clear day of sun and driving cloud I
have been tempted to prefer the northward view, from
the haven or above it; for even from the sea&rsquo;s level
you can see far away past all that long, plain and
low coast to the Carlingford Hills, purple and solid
in their serrated ridge; and beyond, higher, fainter,
and more delicate, Slieve Donard, and all the goodly
company of Mourne Mountains show themselves
against the sky. Nor is the foreground less lovely:
the quaint old port, and, opposite it, the purple and
brown ruggedness of Ireland&rsquo;s Eye, which is divided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
another narrow stretch of blue water (lightly crested,
perhaps, with foam) from the long smooth whiteness
of what we call at Portmarnock the Velvet Strand.
Surely earth has not many things to show more fair.
Yet when you climb the hill (a tram will take the
infirmer) and first see eastward over the wide blue,
then, gradually ascending, get sight of Dublin Bay&rsquo;s
southern shore with the Wicklow Mountains behind
it, and finally of Dublin itself, lying between beauty
and beauty&mdash;beauty of sea, beauty of plain, beauty of
mountain, beauty of azure, of purple, of green&mdash;then,
I think, the southward view will seem to you richer
in variety and incident. For the mountains make a
great mass of round huddling shoulders, their lower
slopes tree-clad; but nothing in the world is more
dainty than the line of peaked summits which, stringing
out from the main mass, carries the eye delighted
with their chiselled shapes from peak to peak downward
to the sea. And away west, past this mountain
mass, Ireland stretches broad and fertile, well timbered,
well watered, a country of park and champaign, fertile
to luxuriance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE RIVER LIFFEY AT PALMERSTON</p></div>
</div>

<p>Beauty is all about you too; for the hill from midsummer
on is purple with heath, and the purple is
set off by gold of the autumn-flowering furze which
grows in little round trim bushes. Lord Howth&rsquo;s
demesne is one of the oldest and most charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>places in Ireland, and it encloses within its precincts
a cromlech under which, so they tell, lies Aideen, wife
of Oscar, Ossian&rsquo;s son, chief hero of those legendary
warriors, the Fianna.</p>

<p>A beauty of more modern date is to be seen by
those wise and fortunate folk who visit Ireland in
May or June: the rocky glen overgrown with choice
rhododendrons and azaleas, which the Howth family
have gathered and cherished. Imagine a steep cliff,
a hundred feet almost sheer, but piled with tumbled
boulders, and through them, up to the very top, bush
after bush of these gorgeous blossoms&mdash;crimson, scarlet,
mauve, buff, yellow, and exquisite diaphanous white.
I never saw rhododendrons anywhere to touch these.
And while we talk of flowers, another sight you can
see from Dublin in May, the like of which takes
visitors to Holland&mdash;the great daffodil and tulip fields
at Rush, some fifteen miles north along the coast.
There, growing in among the pale sandhills and grey
bent, you shall see these huge patches of trumpeting
colour&mdash;acres of tulips, close ranged like soldiers on
parade, all of one type, uniform in their perfection.
And with that you can inspect an industry employing
many workmen and workwomen throughout the year
in a country where work is none too plenty.</p>

<p>One more word about Howth. When you look
from the hill towards Dublin, you look across one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the most famous of modern golf links, that long narrow
spit of sand which is called the North Bull. But
you also look across the scene of one of the notable
battles of history. Between the North Bull and the
Liffey mouth is Clontarf, where the fight raged on
Good Friday in the year 1014, when Brian Boru
inflicted on the Danes of Dublin and their allies from
the Orkneys and from far-off Scandinavia&mdash;yes, and
Irish allies too&mdash;a defeat which was felt all through
the regions that the vikings haunted. It is true to
say that that victory stemmed the advancing tide
of barbarism. Brian won for Christianity rather than
for Ireland, and he lost his life in the fight.</p>

<p>Just near Clontarf parish church, in the grounds
of a private house is a yew tree under which, they
say, men laid down the slain king, nine hundred years
ago. Whether that be historically true or no we
cannot say; but, I am told, experts agree that no
other yew tree in these islands has an appearance
of antiquity at all comparable to this giant, which,
still lusty, covers fully a rood of ground. Try and
see it on your way from Howth: much can be got
(in Ireland) by civil asking.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a></h2>


<p>I come now to deal with what lies south of Dublin&mdash;the
Wicklow Hills with all their apanages. And
here one is conscious of two divisions. First of all,
the obvious cleavage between the sunny seaward-facing
slopes, thickly inhabited, and the mountains
themselves or those glens that lie behind the first
ridges. Secondly, the division, not less notable, between
what is Wicklow pure and simple and what
really belongs to Dublin, just as Brighton and Richmond
belong to London.</p>

<p>This is not a mere question of distance. Dublin
hardly makes itself felt beyond the immediate suburbs
on the north and west: it stops with the tram lines.
And towards the mountains, if you leave your tram at
Rathfarnham, an hour&rsquo;s good walking will take you
into a strangely wild ravine. Follow the military road&mdash;driven
through these hills after 1798 had shown how
strong they were, to be the first effectual instrument
of subjugation&mdash;up towards Glencree, through Rockbrook,
and so by a long steep ascent you will reach
a wood where the road divides, on the shoulder of
Tibradden, or the Kings&rsquo; Burying Ground. To your
right will be Killikee, with Lord Massey&rsquo;s beautiful
demesne, and woods covering it almost to the top,
but the bare summit crowned by a shattered ruin&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
&ldquo;Hell Fire Club&rdquo;, built by young bloods in the wild
duelling and card-playing days of Dublin&rsquo;s gaiety.
Turn your back on this and follow to the left into
Glen Cullen (the Holly Glen), which, dividing Tibradden
from Featherbed, sweeps round behind Two Rock and
Three Rock, and so, if you keep steadily by the left,
brings you back into the suburbs and villadom after
a round of some sixteen miles. But you will have
traversed a glen as bare and lonely, as devoid of
any suggestion of a great city&rsquo;s nearness, as even
Connemara could show.</p>

<p>Very beautiful it is, too, up there, on a fine day;
and bilberries grow to perfection among the deep
heather on the slopes of Featherbed. When I was
last in it, instead of keeping to the left, we cut across
southward to the right by the first road out of the
valley, and from that height saw what is not often
seen&mdash;the coast of Wales clearly visible. Then, dropping
swiftly, we reached a road which, leading from
the city through Dundrum, traverses the Scalp&mdash;a fine
gorge of tumbled stone with fine woods effectively
planted; and so down a famous coaching road to the
pretty village of Enniskerry on the Dargle River, and
down along that river to Bray&mdash;and the train.</p>

<p>So quick and so emphatic is the transition from
one region to the other&mdash;from the region of lonely
car drives to the snug neighbourhood of gas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
steam. But let me define or describe the limits.
If instead of going out by road you take either the
train from Harcourt Street, which skirts the base of
the hills, or the Westland Row line, which follows
the sea all the way through Kingstown and Killiney
till both lines meet in Bray, you will, of course, have
suburbs about you, merging into villadom: and the
suburbs continue on the sealine almost unbroken to
Killiney. Then comes a gap, and at Bray you have
a considerable town, from which villadom&mdash;a very
pleasant and cultivated villadom&mdash;extends towards the
hills. Beyond Bray, the line rounds the face of Bray
Head in a series of little tunnels, with intervening
glimpses of sea dashing below, in the best Riviera
manner; and then you come to Greystones, another
even more suburban settlement. I set Greystones&mdash;some
fifteen miles south of Dublin&mdash;as the suburban
limit: beyond that you have honest country&mdash;Wicklow
proper. Only, let it be clearly understood that this
is no disparagement. The most beautiful things in
Wicklow are outside what I call Wicklow proper, and
inside Dublin&rsquo;s &ldquo;sphere of influence&rdquo;. These I now
proceed to describe.</p>

<p>First of all, there runs up from Bray the famous
Dargle, a steep wooded glen with the river dividing
two demesnes&mdash;Lord Monk&rsquo;s and Lord Powerscourt&rsquo;s.
For miles you can drive or walk through a scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of constantly varying beauty, with glimpses of mountain
behind the wooded slopes, until at last you
come to the Powerscourt Waterfall with its plunge
of a hundred feet out of an upper ravine. Climb
round, get above the waterfall, and at last, on the
slopes of Douse Mountain, you reach wild nature&mdash;and
you forget Dublin. Till then the spirit of Dublin
is with you&mdash;the spirit of a prosperous Dublin, inhabited
by rich men who liked to adorn the countryside
with some of the graces of the town, to set
elaborate plantations of foreign shrubs against a
backing of rock and heather. Very pretty it is, and
nowhere done more prettily.</p>

</div>

<p>Or again, if you go from Bray to Greystones by
road, you may take the short road through Windgates
and traverse the dip in the ridge between the Head
and the Lesser Sugarloaf&mdash;a charming drive&mdash;with
the Head and the sea on your left, the peaked shape
of Sugarloaf on your right, bracken and heather clad,
and over part of its height enclosed in a deerpark full
of sturdy Japanese deer. You may do better still: you
may take the long road and go inland, leaving Little
Sugarloaf on your left, towering up purple and splendid
above you, pineclad on this side to half its height;
then, curving round, come into the defile by Kilmacanoge,
which divides it from the Greater Sugarloaf.
Here now is the parting of the regions. From Kilmacanoge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>a road runs up the Rocky Valley, sweeping
round Great Sugarloaf, and it instantly brings you
into wildness: in half an hour&rsquo;s going you will be
round the mountain and out on the bleak levels of
Calary Bog, with the soft gradual side of Douse
tempting you to run up to the top&mdash;an easy victory.
Yield to that temptation, and, unless your way is
picked knowingly, you will be floundering in heather
shoulder high, ashamed to turn back and almost too
tired to go on. Still, to go on is worth it. Once on
the top of Douse you are in the heart of real Wicklow&mdash;and
you see, far below you, the road winding which
leads out through Sallygap, west of Kippure Mountain
to Kildare and the plains.</p>

<p>But supposing that at Kilmacanoge you do what
forty thousand other people will have done that year
before you, and hold straight on between the Sugar-loaves,
the road, curving gradually eastward and seaward,
brings you into the Glen of the Downs, another
noble defile, wooded to the very crest with scrubby
timber, so close as to be almost impassable&mdash;lovely
as the loveliest in its way. Yet somehow the little
gazebo of an octagonal summerhouse set high up on
the north side in Bellevue grounds stamps the scene.
It is nature, but nature decked and laid out and
caressed and petted by man. A little farther and
the road brings you into Delgany, at the foot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the sloping Bellevue grounds, a village prettier even
than Enniskerry. And in truth Bellevue was a
splendid type of what I have in mind: place and
grounds created in the eighteenth century by a cultivated
Dublin merchant of Huguenot stock; a house
where Grattan was a frequent guest; which till the
other day showed in gathered perfection all the
domestic art of that great period, with its Sheraton
and Chippendale sideboards, its marvellous plaster
cornices and ceilings, its inlaid marble mantelpieces,
and, for a final glory, its bedstead painted by Angelica
Kaufmann. The grounds were planned to match&mdash;in
the same delicate graceful taste, a little mannered,
but always admirable. It had a lovely nature to
work upon, and that same taste has made the seaward
fringe of these nearest Wicklow Hills into the
very garden of Ireland. That is the beauty nearest to
the capital. And if the feeling of trimness wearies
you, all you have to do is leave the road and strike
out where you will across the heather. To their
great honour, the liberality of all landowners in this
playground of Dublin leaves the casual passer-by free
to wander almost as unrestrained as he might be in
Achill or on Slieve League.</p>

<p>For the country which lies beyond Dublin&rsquo;s immediate
playground there is this to be said. Even the
railway going to it is delightful. I know of no prettier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
line than the Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford, and
if its trains are something sluggish, why, you have
the more time to admire the view. Beyond Greystones
you pass through a long marsh, full of wild
fowl, and then come to Wicklow, a pleasant little
town sheltered by its low head. There is an old
Norman keep here, Black Castle, but much more remarkable
is the work of modern builders. Wicklow
Head is adorned with three lighthouses&mdash;one carrying
a light. The first tower was built by a wise and
thoughtful Government, and the lamp duly fixed with
ceremony. But when it came to be lit, seamen reported
that while from certain quarters it was admirably
visible, the Head itself blocked it from half the horizon.
Nothing daunted, Government ordered another tower
to be built on a spot indicated in their offices, and
built it was. This illumined the previously excluded
section of sea, but was shut out from the area lighted
by the first tower. Finally, as a counsel of despair,
they sent down someone to look at the ground, and the
third tower, which now carries the light, was duly
erected. The other two remain as monuments of the
persistence with which the English Government has
sought to do things right in Ireland.</p>

<p>From Wicklow you strike into a new type of
country. Rathnew brings you close to the Devil&rsquo;s
Glen, another Dargle, but one with less urbanity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
more rusticity. At Rathdrum you strike the valley
of the Avonmore, which is the centre of all this beauty
that makes southern Wicklow famous. The line
runs through a wooded ravine with the river below
it, plunging and swirling, and beyond the river you
catch a glimpse of Avondale House, now a school
of forestry, but once known to every Irishman as the
home of Charles Stuart Parnell. The water comes
down here discoloured with mineral washings that
remind one of the chemical investigations which
made up the pleasure of Parnell&rsquo;s strange life. He
dreamed of gold mines in Wicklow&mdash;it was only in
politics that the stern practical bent of his mind
made itself apparent and effectual.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 90%;">
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE MEETING OF THE WATERS, WOODENBRIDGE</p></div>
</div>

<p>A little farther on the Avonbeg meets the Avonmore;
farther yet, beyond Woodenbridge and its hotel,
this main stream is joined by the Aughrim River,
and controversy still rages as to which of the two
confluences was honoured in Moore&rsquo;s melody:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;There is not, in the wide world, a valley so sweet<br />
As that vale in whose bosom the wild waters meet!&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Moore himself very diplomatically said he was not
sure; but at any rate the valley through which the
train runs till it reaches Arklow at the river&rsquo;s outfall is
Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sweet Vale of Avoca&rdquo;; there is no mistake
about that, and no question of its gentle loveliness. Arklow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>itself is an ancient town, whose name keeps,
like Wicklow, a memory of Danish beacon fires&mdash;&ldquo;low&rdquo;
or &ldquo;lue&rdquo; is the word for flame (still preserved
in lowland Scotch). Its population keep the hardy
seagoing tradition&mdash;Ireland has no better fishermen;
but they are incommoded by an odd circumstance.
At this point of the coast there is practically no
rise and fall of tide, and many a useful harbour is
useful only because it can be reached with the flood,
which never comes to Arklow.</p>

<p>Here first one meets a landmark of the great
&ldquo;ninety-eight&rdquo; rising. The Wexford insurgents received
at Arklow the decisive check which curbed
their very wonderful successes. The rebellion spread
no farther north, though, after the rout of Vinegar
Hill, stray parties of fugitives maintained themselves
for long enough in the mountains where the meeting
waters have their rise.</p>

<p>To reach this wider and more open region&mdash;far
less beautiful, yet having for some eyes an even greater
charm&mdash;you should follow up the valley of the Aughrim
River. A train will take you to Aughrim town, then
comes a road, passing at first between slopes of cultivated
and well-planted land. But as you go on, the
valley widens and spreads, the woods recede, and before
you are the great brown flanks of Lugnaquilla, highest
of all the Wicklow Mountains&mdash;higher indeed than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
many a hill in Donegal or Kerry whose bolder shape
gives a far more imposing appearance.</p>

<p>Here at last, far up on the moors, you strike the
military road near its southernmost point; and planted
on it, facing down the glen, is a queer, gaunt, half-ruined
building, evidently a barrack. A barrack it was;
but in more recent times it fell to Parnell, who rented
these moors, and he used it as a shooting-lodge&mdash;furnished
in the roughest way, with a few bedsteads
and chairs. There is a kind of legend about the
haughty, unbending chief, who treated all his followers
with the scantest courtesy. Very different is the
impression I have got from those who were privileged
to walk the hills after birds with him and to
camp in that bare but friendly shelter. To-day, indeed,
its grimness is somewhat mitigated; but, as
you may readily discover, the old barrack has not
lost its associations with the nationalism of to-day.</p>

<p>From Aughavanagh the military road will carry
you north across the hill, till beyond it you reach the
valley of the Avonbeg and Drumgoff Bridge. Here
is the foot of Glen Malure&mdash;boldest and wildest of
all these glens&mdash;which divides Lugnaquilla from Lugduff.
This valley, commanding the pass westward
into the plains at Dunlavin, was always the central
stronghold of the O&rsquo;Byrnes, the great Irish clan who
held out stubbornly among the hills. Lord Grey de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Wilton, Elizabeth&rsquo;s deputy, tried to drive them out
in 1580, but his force was cut to pieces by the
mountaineers, and a few years later they had a sure
asylum to offer to Red Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell, when he
escaped from Dublin Castle and the captivity into
which he had been foully kidnapped.</p>

<p>But the spot in all this region which offers most
attraction to travellers is Glendalough, site of the Seven
Churches, a place of most venerable memories. Kevin,
to whom it owes its fame, was born A.D. 498, sixty-six
years after Patrick first preached in Ireland. His
name, <i>Caomh-ghen</i>, means the <i>Gentle-born</i>, and he
was son of the King of Leinster. The whole of
this princely family became passionately religious,
for two brothers and two sisters of Kevin were
canonized, and their names are in the Calendar.</p>

<p>Kevin was sent for nurture to a Cornish holy
man, St. Petroc, who had come to spread the light
in Wicklow, but the young Prince finished his
studies under the guidance of his own uncle, Eoghan
or Eugenius, who had a monastic school somewhere
in the beautiful parish of Glenealy on the sunny
south-eastern slope of these hills.</p>

<p>He was a handsome lad, and his looks so distracted
a beautiful girl that she tried to seduce him
from his vocation. Modern tradition tells that she
followed him into his cave in the cliff above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
upper lake, and that he flung her out into the water.
The Life of him relates a different version, according
to which he threw her into a bed of nettles and
whipped her with them over her face and arms till,
as the pious author says, the fire without subdued
the fire within, and his discipline determined her to
follow his example and enter the monastic life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 90%;">
<img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ST. KEVIN&rsquo;S BED AND THE CHURCH OF THE ROCK, UPPER LAKE GLENDALOUGH</p></div>
</div>

<p>However that be, Kevin fled from the society of
men&mdash;and women&mdash;to take up his abode in the lovely
but peaceful spot for ever associated with his name:
&ldquo;a valley closed in by lofty and precipitous mountains
beside a lake&rdquo;. &ldquo;On the northern shore&rdquo;, says
the Life, &ldquo;his dwelling was in a hollow tree: but
on the southern shore of the lake, he dwelt in a
very narrow cave, to which there was no access
except by a boat, for a perpendicular rock of immense
height overhangs it from above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is an overstatement: any active man can get
into the Bed from above; but even from below (where
Mr. Williams shows the boat lying in his picture)
it needs some climbing. Within is only room for
a man to sit or lie&mdash;not to stand. But Kevin&rsquo;s dwelling
on the north shore was leafy and bird-haunted,
and the wild creatures, it is said, used to come and
light on his shoulder, and sing their sweetest songs
to God&rsquo;s solitary.</p>

<p>At last his fame went aboard, and folk flocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>to his sanctuary and begged him to found a monastery.
He submitted unwillingly, and let them build him
(still on the slope of the same mountain, Lugduff) a
beehive cell of stones, or &ldquo;skellig&rdquo;: and near it they
built an oratory, <i>Tempul-na-Skellig</i>, on a rock projecting
into the lake&mdash;now wrecked, for, as Archbishop
Healy writes in his <i>Ancient Schools and
Scholars</i>, &ldquo;fifty years of tourists in the mountain valley
have caused more ruin to these venerable monuments
than centuries of civil war&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But there was no room on this cliffy shore, and
Kevin was admonished in a vision to build in the
open space by the outfall of the lower lake. &ldquo;If it
were God&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; said Kevin, &ldquo;I would rather remain
until my death here where I have laboured.&rdquo; &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
said the angel, &ldquo;if you dwell where I bid you, many
blessed souls will have their resurrection there and
go with you to the heavenly kingdom.&rdquo; So Kevin
consented to move; and he built the monastery on
which all those churches and towers sprang up that
can be seen or traced to-day. Yet in this city he
did not depart from his austerities, but slept on the
bare ground and lived on herbs and water.</p>

<p>The foundation of the monastery may date from
about 540. Kevin lived on, they say, till 620, and
died surrounded by his disciples, a man of God and a
peacemaker, among the best beloved of Ireland&rsquo;s saints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>All that great congeries of ruins dating from pre-Norman
times speaks of a very large community. They
are typical. There is the round tower, <i>cloigtheach</i>, a
belfry, place of retreat into which the pious monks
used to retire, drawing up the ladder after them; there
is the big church with high-pitched roof of stone, and
its galaxy of lesser chapels, just as in Ciaran&rsquo;s city
at Clonmacnoise. About these doubtless were numberless
huts of wattle and clay, dwellings of the clergy
and the students. For here was the real metropolitan
see of Irish Leinster. Dublin was a Danish foundation,
and for centuries the primacy was disputed between
them, till the dispute was ended by calling the provincial
see the Archbishopric of Dublin and Glendalough&mdash;joint
dioceses with separate organization to
this day.</p>

<p>For archæological and historic interest no place in
Wicklow can approach this &ldquo;glen of the two lakes&rdquo;,
<i>Gleann Dá Loch</i>. But for romance, I at least should
put Glen Malure far before it; and, for beauty, would
infinitely prefer the lovely cup of Lough Tay or Luggilaw,
where it nestles under the western slopes of Douse.
This, and Lough Dan as well, you can see by a slight
detour on your way to Dublin; and if you have come
by Bray, it is best to take the military road back to
Dublin, which brings you through Sallygap by the
headwaters of the Liffey, and past the other beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
little lake of Lough Bray at the sources of the Glencree
River. So, keeping high among the hills till you
have passed Killakee and begin the descent into
Rathfarnham, you will complete almost the whole
of your journey amid the haunts of shepherd folk
such as those among whom Synge lived, and from
whom first he got his vivid vision of Irish peasant
life&mdash;a vision coloured no doubt by long residence in
far-off Aran, and told in words that keep an echo
of the Gaelic tongue, yet always, as most of our
visions must be, in its essence the vision of that
particular countryside where he was born and bred.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="V" id="V">V</a></h2>


<p>The very antithesis of Wicklow, with its mountains,
its small plunging rivers, and its breed of little light-footed
sheep, is the plain country of Meath, watered
by the deep stream of the Boyne, and grazed over by
the finest and biggest cattle. No other place in
Ireland is so rich in monuments of all the ages; nor
is there anything in Ireland better worth seeing than
the valley of the Boyne itself, from Navan to the
sea.</p>

<p>If I had time and a motor car, I should begin by
driving to Trim, and stopping just short of it at Lara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>cor,
to see where Swift lived in the early days of his
growing fame. At Trim you will find an amazing
cluster of beautiful ruins, but notably &ldquo;King John&rsquo;s
Castle&rdquo;, as fine a specimen of the Norman keep as
can be seen. It was founded in 1173 by Hugh de Lacy,
so no Norman building can be much older in Ireland.
Its history is full of romance&mdash;Richard II held Henry
of Lancaster prisoner there for a while&mdash;and many
deeds of note were done in the old place. But there
is not space to deal with Trim, nor with the beautiful
ruins of Bective Abbey, which you can arrange to
see on the way to what no traveller should leave
unseen&mdash;the Hill of Tara.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 90%;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ON THE RIVER BOYNE AT TRIM</p></div>
</div>

<p>Tara of to-day is only a field or two of rich grass,
covered with the trace of ancient earthworks&mdash;most
curious of them the Banqueting Hall of King Cormac,
a long narrow parallelogram&mdash;250 yards in length by
15 wide&mdash;with the fourteen openings of its doors still
traceable, as they are shown in two plans preserved
in very ancient Irish manuscripts. But for the
detail of these monuments you must consult the plan
in Mr. Cooke&rsquo;s admirable &ldquo;Murray&rdquo;; for some general
account of the history of Tara I may refer to my
own <i>Fair Hills of Ireland</i>. Here I single out only
one thread in that vast fabric of associations.</p>

<p>Looking north-east from Tara you will see easily
(any child can point it out) another somewhat higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>rise of ground, seven or eight miles distant&mdash;the Hill
of Slane. That is where, on Easter Eve in the year
433, Patrick lighted the Paschal fire which gave menace
and warning to the High King and his druids, keeping
their state on Tara. It was a bold challenge, for a
great druidic festival was in preparation, and no
man in Meath was permitted to light a flame till Tara
itself should give the beacon signal; and the night of
that challenge is a marking-point in the history of
Ireland&mdash;even in the history of the world.</p>

<p>For in that period of the fifth century, all Europe,
as we know it to-day, was included within Rome&rsquo;s
Empire, save for two exceptions&mdash;the outlying retreats
of Scandinavia and of Ireland. Christianity was the
religion of the Empire, the religion of civilization,
and there is little doubt but that before Patrick&rsquo;s
coming Christianity had got some footing in the
south-eastern parts of Ireland, which were in closest
commerce with Great Britain.</p>

<p>Patrick, by birth a Briton (almost certainly of
Wales), was a Roman born in the same sense as St.
Paul; his father was an official of the Empire; and
from his father&rsquo;s house he was carried into captivity
by these outer barbarians of Ireland. In his captivity
he found his mission, escaped, with the fixed design
to prepare himself for it, and spent thirty years on
that preparation before, in 432, he came back to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
captivity captive. He touched at a port in south-eastern
Ireland&mdash;probably Wicklow&mdash;but stood on
with his vessel, coasting past Dublin Bay till he landed
again for water and provisions at the little island of
Skerries, which since then is called Inishpatrick. Still
north he sailed, up to Strangford Lough, where, landing,
he made his first convert, the chief Dichu, and founded
his first church&mdash;Down Patrick&mdash;where many years
later he returned to die. Here for a time he sojourned.
Before he turned south there was an errand he had
to do, to bring his message to the valley of the Braid,
in Antrim, where he had been a captive, herding swine
on the slopes of Slemish. But at last, in the spring
of 433, he set his face to the very core and centre of
his purpose&mdash;the evangelization of Ireland at the
fountain head of pagan civilization and pagan power.
For the success of Patrick&rsquo;s mission lay in this. He
addressed himself to the chiefs, he bearded the pagan
in his strong places: he won those who carried others
with them. That was the method he had learnt in
more than a generation of labour, spent seeking
knowledge throughout Europe &ldquo;in the college of the
Lateran at Rome, at Cecina on the Tuscan Sea, at
Auxerre in Gaul&rdquo;, jealously profiting by his right as
a citizen of the Empire, before the Empire should
crumble, and knowledge and religion perish with it,
under the redoubled assaults of barbarism. No man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
will despise the Hill of Slane who realizes what lay
behind the kindling of Patrick&rsquo;s watchfire. I quote
a passage from a great Irish writer, who had the
gift of seeing things in their relations&mdash;the late Sir
William Butler. It is from his last volume <i>The
Light of the West</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;The Easter Eve, 433, is falling dark and cold upon the realm
of Ireland&mdash;dark and cold because to-morrow is sacred to the
idols&mdash;and it has long been ruled in Druids&rsquo; law that on the
night preceding the great fast of Tamhair no fire is to burn on
hearth or hill&mdash;no light is to gleam from palace or hovel until the
flame of the sacred pile, kindled by the king on the green &lsquo;rath&rsquo;
at Tara, shall be seen burning over the plains of Meath. So the
twilight comes down, the light lessens in the west, and the wide
landscape is wrapt in deep and solemn gloom, as though it had
been a land in which man&rsquo;s presence was unknown. While yet
the sun was high in heaven, the missionary had quitted his boat
in the estuary of the River Boyne, and had passed on foot along
the river valley towards the interior of Meath. Evening found
the little band encamped upon a grassy ridge on the north side
of the Boyne, and overlooking the winding channel of that river.
To the south, some miles away, the hill of Tara was in sight.
The March evening fell chilly upon the pilgrims; but the hillside
yielded store of furze-faggot and oak-branch, and soon a camp
fire blazed upon the ridge, casting around a wide circle of light
into the momentarily deepening sea of darkness. What memories
of far-off nights on the Antrim hills come to the pilgrim over the
mists of thirty years, as here he stands in the firelight, on Irish
soil again! How much has passed since last the furze-faggot
warmed his lonely shepherd&rsquo;s bivouac! How much has yet to
be in all yon grim surrounding gloom ere his task shall be accomplished!
Never in all the ages of the world has the might of
savage man been more manifest on earth. Already the Vandal
king is in Carthage; the Visigoths are seated at Toulouse; Attila<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
has reached the Rhine, having ridden his charger over the ashes
of the Eastern Empire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here, in the light of the solitary fire, stands an unarmed,
defenceless man, who, even now, keeps this Easter Eve as a vigil
of battle against the powers of Pagan darkness, throned over
yonder in all the might of armed multitudes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The darkness deepens over the scene; the March winds smite
the faggot flame, and around the lonely bivouac the breezes come
filled with the vast sadness of the night. Feeble to outward sense
must seem the chances of the coming struggle. But the inner
sense of the Great Missionary may this night be looking upon
a different vision. Beyond the bleak ridge and circle of firelight&mdash;out
beyond void of darkness, perchance those deep-sunk eyes
are beholding glimpses of future glory to the Light he has come
to spread; and it may be that his ear, catching in the echoes of
the night wind the accents of ages yet to be, is hearing wondrous
melodies of sound rolling through the starlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... Yes, there was light far away in the West&mdash;out in the
great ocean&mdash;far down below the sunset&rsquo;s farthest verge&mdash;from
westmost hilltop, the New World lay waiting for the light. It
came&mdash;borne by the hands of Ireland&rsquo;s starving children. The
old man tottered with the precious burthen from the fever-stricken
ship; the young child carried the light in feeble hands to the shore;
the strong man bore it to the Western prairies, and into the cañons
of snowy sierras; the maiden brought it into the homestead to be
a future dower to her husband and a legacy to her children; and
lo! ere famine&rsquo;s night had passed from Ireland, the Church of
Patrick arose o&rsquo;er all that vast new world of America, from where
the great St. Lawrence pours its crystal tide into the daybreak
of the Atlantic, to where California flings wide her &lsquo;golden gate&rsquo;
to the sunsets of the Pacific. Nearly 1400 years have gone since,
on the 17th of March, 493, Patrick passed from earth to Heaven.
Empires have flourished and gone down, whole peoples have passed
away, new faiths have arisen, new languages have sprung up, new
worlds have been born to man; but those fourteen centuries have
only fed the fire of that faith which he taught the men of Erin,
and have spread into a wider horizon the light he kindled. And
if there be in the great life beyond the grave a morning trumpet-note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>to sound the réveillé of the army of the dead, glorious indeed
must be the muster answering from the tombs of fourteen centuries
to the summons of the Apostle of the Gaels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor scarce less glorious can be his triumph when the edge of
sunrise, rolling around this living earth, reveals on all the ocean
isles and distant continents, the myriad scattered children of the
Apostle, whose voices answering that sunrise rollcall re-echo in
endless accents along the vaults of heaven.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>That is no untrue vision. Rome went down in
blood and dust, and in the centuries that followed, if
the lamp of learning was not wholly quenched, it was
because Patrick had kindled, in this remote island
beyond the bounds of Empire, &ldquo;the Light of the
West&rdquo;; if Christianity did not perish in the weltering
chaos, it was very largely due to the fruit of the seed
which Patrick sowed.</p>

<p>Miracles are mingled with the story of that Easter
evangelization. Laoghaire, the king (pronounce him
&ldquo;Laery&rdquo;, which has been softened into &ldquo;Leary&rdquo;), set
out to meet him, but stopped short of the Boyne, and
the Christian came into the camp chanting a verse of
Scripture: &ldquo;Some in chariots, some in horses, but
we in the name of the Lord our God&rdquo;. At his coming,
Erc, the king&rsquo;s chief judge, rose up and did him
homage; but a druid blasphemed, and Patrick wrought
a miracle of destruction. And next day he was bidden
to Tara, and ambushes were set for him on the road;
but he changed his people into deer, and so they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
escaped and reached the king&rsquo;s dun, and other miracles
were wrought in it. At all events, by whatever means,
Patrick made converts among the king&rsquo;s own kindred,
and Laoghaire, though he himself would not change,
left him free to preach, and probably welcomed his
help in writing down the laws and customs of Ireland.
For wherever Patrick went he spread the arts of peace,
and Ireland was not slow to profit by them. Take
one instance only. On the hill of Slane a great
monastery grew up, centre of learning as well as of
arts, so famous that in the middle of the seventh
century, Dagobert II, heir to the throne of France,
came here to be educated, away from the weltering
turmoil of Continental Europe.</p>

<p>Of that monastery there is not even so much trace
as can be seen of Tara&rsquo;s greatness, yet within four
miles of it are monuments of surpassing interest that
show the Ireland of a day before St. Patrick, and
others that show the Ireland which he made. On
the north bank, at New Grange and at Dowth, are
the burying places of prehistoric kings: gigantic structures
of huge monoliths, stone slabs, each of them
man-high, so arranged that standing stones make a
passage, roofed with other huge blocks, and this
passage leads to a vaulted chamber, built in the
same marvellous fashion. How on earth these stones
were handled no man can guess, yet there they
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>&mdash;Cyclopean architecture with a vengeance. But these
habitations of the dead are not exposed to daylight,
for over the whole structure was heaped a mound of
lesser stones, so huge that the whole thing covers an
acre of ground, and now, grass-grown and tree-covered,
stands out like a natural hill&mdash;into whose recesses
you may burrow fearfully along this amazing corridor.
Strange spiral ornamentation on the stones at New
Grange is the joy and bewilderment of archæologists;
and though we know the names of kings who
were buried there, we can only guess vaguely at the
builders of these structures, comparable to the tomb
under which Agamemnon rests in Mycenæ.</p>

<p>Nearer to Drogheda, not less interesting, and far
more beautiful, are two monuments of Christian Ireland.
One is the ancient monastic settlement of
Monasterboice, where stand a round tower, two small
ancient churches, and for its supreme interest, two
huge stone crosses covered with the most elaborate
sculpture, on Scriptural subjects, presenting churches,
monks, and warriors as they were in Ireland of the
ninth or tenth century. One of the two crosses is
signed by its deviser, Muiredach, probably the Muiredach
whose death is recorded at 924 A.D., and purely
Celtic art has no more important monument.</p>

<p>A few miles off is the other ruin, which shows what
point monastic civilization had reached in Ireland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
before yet the Normans had crossed the sea. The
Cistercian Abbey of Mellifont was the first of its
order in Ireland, and it was built by Irish craftsmen
trained at Clairvaux, in Normandy. Enough of the
ruin is left to show how noble and how pure was the
work of these early builders, who brought into Ireland
the Norman civilization but not the Norman rule. Yet
there is also the monument of her who gets the blame
of bringing in the hostile, not the peaceful, invasion.
Dervorgilla is buried there, O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s wife, whose
abduction by Dermot MacMurrough led to MacMurrough&rsquo;s
banishment from Ireland, and so to his
calling in of foreign aid.</p>

<p>De Lacy&rsquo;s castle at Trim is not the only evidence
that the Normans, when they came, were quick to
fasten upon this fertile valley. At Randalstown, near
Navan, Colonel Everard&rsquo;s tobacco plantations are an
object of interest to thousands to-day; but perhaps
not many of them realize that this enterprising country
gentleman is living to-day where his forefathers have
lived since the first of them got a grant there in the
twelfth century, among the other knights and squires
who rode with De Lacy. Norman they were and
Irish they soon became, yet here in the pale they
kept far more distinct than the Geraldines of Desmond
or the De Burgos of Connaught; and so they kept on
the lucky side, the side whose supremacy was finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>established when William of Orange fought his way
across the fords at Oldbridge.</p>

<p>Oldbridge is only about a mile upstream from
Drogheda, and an obelisk marks the site of the
famous Battle of the Boyne. The battle was decided
before it was fairly begun, because a large force had
been thrown across the bridge at Slane, and thus
turned the Irish position, which lay along the south
bank from opposite the Mattock River to where the
hill rises steep below Oldbridge. Schomberg fell in
the ford above the island, probably some two hundred
yards below the present bridge&mdash;fell rallying his
Huguenots like a hero.</p>

<p>No record of brutality sullies that feat of arms;
but at Drogheda, one of the most picturesquely
situated towns in Ireland, and made more picturesque
by the high viaduct which here spans the river, there
are terrible memories connected with those old defences
of which one part remains perfect&mdash;St. Laurence&rsquo;s
Gate with its two-storied tower. Here it was that
Cromwell perpetrated the first of those massacres
which disgrace his name. Such of the captured as
were not slain were sent for slaves to the West Indies,
where to-day in certain islands a debased Irish can
be heard from negroes, and Irish names are general
among the negro population.</p>

<p>Yet in that lovely valley it is hard to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
cruelties. Historic records crowd so thick in it that
one has scarcely time to speak of beauty. And yet
from the ridge of the hill above Monasterboice is a
view which pleases me beyond almost anything I
know in Ireland. Midway on that northern plain one
has the Mourne Mountains beyond fertile levels to
the north, the Dublin Hills beyond fertile levels to
the south, and the blue sea close at hand abreast of
all. Still, you may match that elsewhere in Ireland;
you cannot match the river itself. From Navan a little
leisurely steamer will take you to Drogheda, dodging
from canal into river, from river back to canal, through
scenery as fertile and as cultivated as the banks of
the Thames, yet rendered far more beautiful by the
charm of the river itself&mdash;a typical salmon stream,
with its pools, its plunging flood, its long swirling
reaches. I have written of it elsewhere and may
perhaps be allowed to quote my own writing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;... Above Navan the Boyne is sedgy and weed-choked; but
if you follow the towpath down from Navan, between canal and
river, you will find yourself heaping scorn on the Thames. Here
are wide spaces of smooth water, with steep wooded banks beyond
them&mdash;banks ambered, when I saw them last, with all the tones
of autumn. But (since Boyne is a famous salmon stream, and
way must be made for the running fish) here are no high lock-gates
damming back the water in long sluggish flats. Everywhere
the run is brisk, and constantly broken by low weirs,
under which long races swirl and bubble in a way to tantalize every
angler, and delight even those who do not know the true charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of a salmon pool. When I came in sight of Dunmor Castle,
a ruined Norman keep of the sixteenth century, perched high
on a bare grassy cliff above one of these lashers, it seemed that
here was surely the finest point of all; but after I had passed
Stackallen bridge, and was travelling now down the left bank,
I learnt my error. Under the woods of Stackallen House, canal
and river merge into one broad stream, closely pent by precipitous
banks, variously wooded. Below the lock, where the canal joins
the main water, a pool begins, stretching some two hundred yards
straight down, until it is closed by a cliff of ochre-tinted rock,
bold and bare among the foliage. So swift is the rush from the
lasher, so far does it swirl down into this reach, that the water
has no look of dullness; it is a pool, not a stretch. I walked on
quickly, eager to see what lay around the sharp bend, and suddenly
towards me there swung round the cliff a barge, brightly painted.
The line of its sides, the fan-shaped curve of the wave spreading
outwards and backwards, as the craft drew towards me, had a
beauty in that setting that only sight could realize. If any spot
of the world is enchanted, it must be that water; and as you
round the cliff it is more beautiful still. For there, under Beaupark
House, is a cliff answering that on the Stackallen bank,
and a precipitous lawn beside it; and the river, bending south here
at right angles, then breaking out again, stately and splendid,
on its old line due east, has movement and stillness all in one;
it is a sliding, swirling mirror for banks which well deserve such
a glass to echo their perfection.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>That valley is to my mind the most beautiful and
the most typically beautiful thing in Leinster. For
Leinster is the province of cultivated fertility; it is
also the province of great and beautiful rivers. The
Shannon, except from Killaloe and Limerick, is somewhat
lacking in beauty; it has majesty, but not charm.
In Leinster the rivers are more manageable in size&mdash;the
Nore, the Barrow, the Boyne, the Liffey, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Slaney. Each of them has its own character; and
the lower tidal reaches of the Slaney, reed-fringed
and swan-haunted, are not less lovely than the salmon
pool in the upper waters near Carlow which Mr.
Williams has drawn so lovingly. And those who
imagine Ireland as a country of mere beggary might
find something to learn as well as to see either
amid the fertility of Meath or again in South Leinster,
where a poorer soil has been tilled into high perfection.
The valley of the Nore in particular is affluent in loveliness
from its banks at Kilkenny, where Moore courted
the pretty actress who made him the best of wives,
down to the head of the tideway at Inistiogue, where
under the shelter of Mr. Tighe&rsquo;s great woods you can
stay at a neat little hotel in a charming village, and
fish to heart&rsquo;s content in splendid pools and shallows,
where trout and salmon are plenty, and if you cannot
catch them, it must be either your fault or theirs.
And if they are hard to capture&mdash;as I found them
in weather which all but fishermen adored&mdash;that is
just because it is a free water, because here as everywhere
there is something of that easy live and let
live spirit which endears Ireland to those that know
her, and which everywhere makes the visitor welcome&mdash;perhaps
with most natural kindliness in those parts
which are least accustomed to look upon the stranger
as a source of revenue. The most beautiful places in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Leinster are far less known to Englishmen than the
barren cliffs of Achill. Yet if you go to Inistiogue,
or any similar place in Leinster, you will begin to
realize why it is that in Leinster only of the provinces
does the population increase in these days.</p>

<p>There, under the new conditions of tenure, the
farmer begins to invest freely, his money and his
labour, upon soil that can repay exertion, and under
a climate that has none of Ulster&rsquo;s harshness. In
Wexford, where most of the Irish tobacco was grown
till the growing of it was prohibited by an amazing
Act of Parliament some seventy years ago, the plant
took so kindly to the soil that it perpetuated itself
without cultivation: and when (after infinite solicitation
and man&#339;uvring) leave was given us to revive this
industry, the distinctive variety was recovered from
these casual plants, and has been cultivated among
other species in Colonel Edwards&rsquo;s farm at Navan.
Now a soil and a climate in which tobacco will reproduce
itself in the wild state is a rare combination
so far north, and Wexford men are trying to utilize
its advantages.</p>

<p>In Carlow and Kilkenny one sees prosperity too
on every side, while Louth disputes the palm with
Wexford. Only on the richest land of all, through
Meath into Kildare, is there the lamentable spectacle
of depopulation&mdash;a rich wilderness. Yet even there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>it is to be hoped that the spread of co-operation and
the gradual work of land settlement may undo some
of the mischief wrought by reckless clearances.</p>

<p>Those who in visiting Ireland have too often found
images and memories of beauty marred by the association
of ragged poverty, overshadowed by a very
cloud of despair, may find in Leinster at least a
beauty where all the omens are hopeful and where,
even beside the ruins only too evident, a strong new
fabric of industry is being built up.</p>
